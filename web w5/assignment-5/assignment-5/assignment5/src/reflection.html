      <h2>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</h2>
      <p>
        Responsive design is a fundamental concept in web development, focusing on crafting websites
        and applications that seamlessly adjust to different screen sizes and devices. The primary
        goal is to maintain a consistent and user-friendly experience, whether users access the site
        on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. This adaptability is achieved through the use of
        flexible grids, images, and media queries, allowing the layout to dynamically respond to the
        unique dimensions of each device.
      </p>

      <h2>How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h2>
      <p>
        Responsive design is intricately connected with key web technologies like HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. HTML serves as the foundation for structure, CSS handles styling, and JavaScript
        adds an extra layer of interactivity. Within CSS, media queries play a crucial role by
        allowing developers to implement diverse styles depending on the specific features of the
        device, such as its width, height, or orientation.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Through extensive research and hands-on experience, I've learned that building web apps for
        different devices requires great attention to detail. It involves a combination of flexible
        grid layouts, fluid images, and media queries. Prioritizing content and optimizing images
        for performance are crucial aspects of creating a responsive design that not only looks good
        but also loads quickly on diverse devices.
      </p>

      <h2>Describe your learning experience in the course.</h2>
      <p>
        Participating in the WEB222 course has been a rewarding journey. The modules on responsive
        design provided a comprehensive understanding of the importance of creating web
        applications. The practical assignments, including the development of responsive pages and
        applications, equipped me with valuable skills applicable in real-world scenarios.
      </p>

      <p>
        Collaborating with peers, engaging in discussions, and receiving constructive feedback from
        the professor has significantly enhanced my learning experience. The course structure,
        combining theoretical concepts with hands-on projects, allowed me to grasp the principles of
        responsive design effectively.
