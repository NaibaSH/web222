        The rise of streaming services means there are more options than ever about which movies to watch and how to watch them. But those options have also left a lot of us jaded.
        “I don’t know what I want, streaming service, figure it out for me” is a high barrier for any movie or recommendation algorithm to overcome. Instead, decide what you want to watch before you turn on the TV, like you’re headed to a movie theater. Actively looking forward to watching a specific film puts you in a better, more curious, more engaged mindset before you’ve even started.

How do you pick one movie when there’s so much out there? First off, keep your own running “films to watch” list — when you see a trailer, hear a recommendation, or catch a reference to something that sounds like your kind of thing, jot it down somewhere accessible, like a memo app in your phone, your preferred streaming service’s queue function, or movie-focused trackers like JustWatch and Letterboxd. Anything to replace that sense of “Eh, nothing better to do, guess I’ll put on a movie” with a sense of anticipation.
